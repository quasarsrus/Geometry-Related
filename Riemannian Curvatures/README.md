Compute the Riemannian curvature tensor, Ricci tensor, and the Ricci scalar of 2-manifolds (with a Riemannian metric). Implementation is motivated by http://www.rdrop.com/~half/math/torus/torus.geodesics.pdf.
Extension to n-manifolds is conceptually not difficult since one simply induces the metric tensor from the n+1 dimensional ambient space (usually \mathbb{R}^{n+1}) but computing
n^3 Christoffel symbols and n^4 Riemannian curvature tensor components can quickly get very tasking.
